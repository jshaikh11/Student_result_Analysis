# Student Result Analysis  

## Overview  

The Student Result Analysis project is designed to visualize and analyze the academic performance of students using Python's Seaborn and 
Matplotlib libraries. This project aims to provide insights into student performance trends, subject-wise distribution, and correlations 
between different subjects through various visualizations.

## Installation  

To run this project, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can then install the required packages using pip:  

 
pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib

## Usage

Place your dataset file (e.g., expanded_data_with_more_features.csv) in the project directory.

## Data
This project uses a sample dataset of student results. The dataset contains the following columns:

Gender: gender of each student
Parent Education: Describe the education of parents
Transport Means: Answers the question-how does the child come to school?
Score: Score obtained by the student in each subject

## Visualization
The project generates various visualizations to analyze student results, including:

Distribution of Scores: Histograms and KDE plots to show score distributions.
Subject-wise Performance: Boxplots to depict scores across different subjects.
Correlation Heatmap: Heatmaps to visualize correlations between scores in different subjects.
Grades Distribution: Count plots to show the distribution of grades among students.
